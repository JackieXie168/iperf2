2.0.7 change set (rjmcmahon@rjmcmahon.com) August 2014
	o Linux only version which supports end/end latency (assumes clocks synched)
	o Support for smaller report interval  (5 milliseconds or greater)
	o End/end latency with UDP (mean/min/max), display in milliseconds with resolution of microseconds
	o Socket read timeouts (server only) so iperf reports occur regardless of no received packets
	o Report timestamps now display millisecond resolution
	o Local bind supports port value using colon as delimeter (-B 10.10.10.1:60001)
	o Use linux realtime scheduler and packet level timestamps for improved latency accuracy
	o Suggest PTP on client and server to synch clocks to microsecond
	o Suggest a quality reference for the PTP grandmaster such as a GPS disciplined oscillator from companies like Spectracom

2.0.6 change set (rjmcmahon@rjmcmahon.com) March 2014
	o Increase the shared memory for report headers reducing mutex contention.
	o Needed to increase performance.
	o Minor code change that should be platform/os independent

* increased NUN_REPORT_HEADERS to reduce conditional semaphore contention
* Allowed for small report intervals (5 ms vs 500 ms)
	
2010-07-08 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* bumped default TCP send/recv buffer to 128K (this is not the kernel buffer
that controls the window, but rather the Iperf internal buffer)

2010-04-10 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* update autoconf goo using Autoconf 2.65, this should help portability a bit

2010-04-02 Ralf Lübben

* honor -i flag when for a server (-s) when using TCP
* tracker issue 2836973

2010-04-01 Deny IP Any Any <denyipanyany@gmail.com>

* Exit rather than warn on connection failure

2010-03-31 Gerrit Renker <grenker@users.sourceforge.net>

* Gerrit Renker's version of Ingo's Molnar's patch to further reduce CPU usage
* tracker issue 2006708

2010-03-31 Gerrit Renker <grenker@users.sourceforge.net>

* "neater" output for some units, eg Kbps, Mbps, Gbps
* addresses some typos

2008-05-09 Gerrit Renker <grenker@users.sourceforge.net>

* replace costly gettimeofday() with nanonsleep() See:

2008-05-09 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* change currLen to unsigned to squelch warning generated by Nathan's patch

2008-05-09 Nathan Jones <nmjones@users.sourceforge.net>

* prevent underflow when the amount of data to be transmitted (-n) is not a
multiple of the buffer size (-l)  Patch:

2008-04-08 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* print report headers only once
* use appropriate report header for UDP tests

2008-04-07 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* Add man page to autoconf goo
* Bump the version in autoconf
* Add missing LICENSE file

2008-04-04 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* Incorporate help string fixes from Claus Klein
* Incorporate patch to restore header line in stats output from Claus Klein
* Reworked help string code to remove redundancy
* Add initial man page

2008-03-19 Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@linux-foundation.org>

* Add new option to allow selecting the sender congestion control
algorithm. This is a Linux specific extension useful for testing
other congestion control algorithms.

2008-03-19 Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@linux-foundation.org>

* Use sched_yield rather than usleep(0) as it behaves better on Linux

2008-03-12 Jon Dugan <jdugan@x1024.net>

* Rework Client::RunTCP so to update the stats for every packet if -i is set.
If -i is not set then the stats are only updated at the end of the run. This
was fallout of Andrew's patch.

* Added -Wall to CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS.  This generated a lot of noise in the
autotools generated files.

* Added initial AUTHORS file.  This is incomplete, but it's a start.

2008-03-12 Andrew Gallatin <gallatin@gmail.com>

* Rework threading.  This is done by having a condition variable for the reporting
thread rather than using sched_yield and/or usleep.  

* Address performance issues on non Linux systems by avoiding system calls
which are expensive on platforms other than Linux.

* Fixes from FreeBSD ports: max_size_t is now 64 bits and not Iperf does not
exit on ENOBUFS.

2007-10-01 JSE <jestabro@ncsa.uiuc.edu>

* ChangeLog file added

2007-10-05 JSE <jestabro@ncsa.uiuc.edu>

* Thread.c (thread_stop): "pthread_cancel (oldTID )" should be
"pthread_cancel (thread->mTID)"
